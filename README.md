# 👋 Hey there, I'm Diya Prakash

I'm a passionate **Data Science enthusiast** with a strong drive for **research and development** in the fields of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. My work spans across **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision (CV)**, where I’ve built and evaluated models that solve real-world problems.

I’m deeply curious about the evolving landscape of **Generative AI**, and I’m currently exploring ways to integrate GenAI into practical, impactful applications. From understanding signals like EEG for cognitive load detection to crafting intelligent systems, I enjoy building solutions that blend data, insight, and innovation.
